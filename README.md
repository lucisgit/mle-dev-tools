mle-dev-tools
=============

This is one of the chrome tools we wrote to make our lives easier when
debugging an issue on one of our servers.

Installation
------------

### Google Chrome

* Clone this repository
* Open the [Chrome Extensions settings](chrome://extensions)
* Enable Developer mode
* Select the Load unpacked extension...
* Navigate to the unpacked directory

Background
----------

Our infrastructure utilises a pair of software load balancers with a number
of application servers behind them. The load balancers are selected using
DNS round robin (with VIPs migrated between them). The application servers
are selected based on a session cookie injected by haproxy.

Our balancing cookie is called 'MLE'. We additionally inject an additional
header (X-Whom) to identify the load balancer in use.

It is possible to view both the Cookie, and header by using the Chrome
developer tools, but this is much easier and means that they are available
in a single location.

To insert the X-Whom header, we use the following nginx configuration:
  add_header X-Whom "fe0";

The content of this header is generated by our configuration management system.

Todo
----

* Add settings to allow you to configure which servers to watch for and which cookies/headers to show for each server
* Pack this up properly
* Add support for other browsers
